Project Guide

Hosted at: https://nba.cjk17.com/

This project was extremely satisfying to imagine and build and uses HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, React, and an API. Though I was not able to create EXACTLY what I had in mind at the beginning, I was still able to create something I was proud of. Originally I wanted to create a sports app similar to ESPN or theScore, but I quickly realized that this was going to be almost impossible given the time that I had. I changed the scope to just giving simple stats for games (score, score by quarter, time remaining, etc.), and started building this tool. I quickly realized that the API I had chosen was not going to work and had to change scope again. At this time I found the Ball Don't Lie API (https://www.balldontlie.io/). This was even simpler but worked extremely well (with a couple of errors that I will discuss). Once I decided what I could do and how to do it I had a successful project that I am proud of. Below I will outline features and give a short guide.

Features/Guide

1. First, the app loads with a static game that was being played while I built the app. In future iterations I would like this to load with games for the current day but because of the break in NBA play (right before playoffs) while developing, that made this slightly challenging.
2. There are two main features that this site has:
    a. The ability to enter a date into the form and see the games/scores for that day.
    b. The ability to click on a game and have it become the focused game (featured at the top).
3. This site does have a major error, but they are related to the API and not the code:
    a. If the API is too busy a response will not contain the needed info, I have coded in an error to mention this. Because of this in future iterations I would strive to find another API with more info and more stablitiy/scalability. This would help to fix the issue and expand the functionality of the app with a more robust API.
4. I am really proud of this, especially the CSS. I have really enjoyed styling this website and think it is really cool that I was able to build something that does this!
